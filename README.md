# fusionics
Fusionics is to Fusion Power what Avionics is to Aerospace.

This repo contains mostly documentation which expands this definition.  It includes some high level descriptions
of Fusion Power projects and roadmaps and from these extracts use cases which must be addressed for society to
be able to deliver robust, resilient and practical Fusion Power Plants in respect of the control systems.

Electronic and software systems have many features which are intangible, and non-intuitive to the lay-person.
The goal of this project is to advocate for the need to address an important, but subtle challenge.  Success will be
when it becomes possible to use the term fusionics in a C-suite context and have the key stakeholders immediately
understand the issues that sit behind this.

Fusion power facilities have a very broad range of control requirements.  Many can already be addressed by
commercial, off the shelf components, configured by tools and using well established methods to achieve 
defined and measurable standards in respect of functionality and quality.  However, there is a subset of 
systems in the sensor and real-time plasma control and protection domain where state of the art is to create
First of a Kind (FoaK) custom systems.  These are good, but they are not yet industrial quality, and there is
not a viable supply chain able to design, implement, modify, maintain and support them.

As a scientist, I am always open to challenge, alternative ideas and evidence which contradicts my hypothesis.
As such - I warmly welcome any response to this concept.  Prove to me that there is already a supply chain able
to meet the need and I will be very happy to change direction.  Suggest a variation on the theme - a better and broader goal, or a neater word which better encapsulates the vision and I'll change it.

If you've read this far and have an interest in helping me to make the case, then please get in touch, and share this project widely in your circle.
